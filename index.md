## OWASP Web Testing Environment

OWASP WTE, or OWASP Web Testing Environment, is a collection of application security tools and documentation available in multiple formats such as VMs, Linux distribution packages, Cloud-based installations and ISO images.

## Introduction

The OWASP WTE project is an enhancement of the original [OWASP Live CD Project](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project) and expands the offering from a static Live CD ISO image to a collection of sub-projects. Its primary goal is to

  Make application security tools and documentation easily available and easy to use.

## Description

At its heart, OWASP WTE is a collection of easy to use application security tools and documentation. WTE has a variety of ways to distribute them:

* Virtual Machines for VMware, VirtualBox and Parallels
* Invidividual Debian packages (.deb) which attempt to be Linux disto agnostic.
  * Tested against Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Kali, etc.
* A bootable ISO image
* Hosted on various Cloud providers
* Ala Carte mix-and-match installations for special purposes

The project is focused at providing a ready environment for testers, developers or trainers to learn, enhance, demonstrate or use their application security skills. It's been an active OWASP project since 2008 and has had over 300,000 downloads.

Beyond the collection of tools from OWASP and other security projects, OWASP WTE has begun producing and including its own security tools, especially where there were no existing tools which fit a particular need.
